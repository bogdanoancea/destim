#' @title Returns \eqn{\xi} like in the Baum-Welch algorithm.
#'
#' @description Returns the smooth joint probability mass function for consecutive
#' states, which is usually called \eqn{\xi} in the Baum-Welch algorithm.
#' Smooth states are marginal but as they are far to be independent it is convenient to
#' have some information about their dependence. This function returns the joint probability
#' mass function for two time consecutive states, conditional on the observations. This agrees
#' with the so called \eqn{\xi} from the Baum-Welch algorithm.
#'
#' It is returned as a matrix, so that the said joint probability for time instants i - 1 and i
#' are the columns from i - 1 times the number of states plus one, to i times the number of
#' states.
#'
#' @param x A HMM model.
#' @param e A vector with the observed events. It admits missing values.
#'
#' @return A sparse matrix. The number of rows is the number of states, and the number of columns
#' is the number of states times the number of observed events minus one. Each full row square
#' slice of the output matrix corresponds to a joint probability mass function, so it sums up
#' to one.
