#' Sets the initial state to the steady state
#'
#' The initial a-priori distribution is set to the steady state of
#' the transition matrix.
#'
#' The steady state is computed as the first eigenvector found that
#' the absolute difference of its eigenvalue and one is less than
#' the square root of machine epsilon.
#'
#' The Markov Chain is expected to be irreducible and aperiodic. The
#' first because otherwise the devices would not have freedom of
#' movement. The second because some probabilities from one state
#' to itself are expected to be non zero. This implies that there
#' exists one unique steady state.
#'
#' However, while highly encouraged, it is not enforced and it is
#' possible to define a non irreducible or non aperiodic model. It
#' is not recommendable to use initsteady with such model, as
#' the function only returns one of the steady states.
#'
#'
#' @param x A HMM object.
#'
#' @return The same HMM object of the input with its initial state set
#' to steady state.
