#' @title The forward part of the FB algorithm
#'
#' @description Calculates the forward probabilities.
#' The main purpose of this function is to be combined with backward function
#' to calculate smooth states and smooth consecutive pairwise states. This is done
#' by functions \code{sstates} and \code{scpstates}.
#'
#' @param x A HMM model.
#' @param y A vector with the observed events. It admits missing values.
#'
#' @return A list with two elements:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \emph{alpha} is a matrix that contains the filtered states.
#' The number of columns coincides with the number of observations,
#' so that column k contains the filtered state at the same time as
#' y[k] is observed. For missing (un)observed values, the predicted
#' state is returned instead.
#' \item \emph{scalefactors} is a vector that contains the likelihood
#' of each observation conditioned on all the observation from its
#' past. It is conveniently set to one for missing (un)observed values,
#' so that the joint likelihood is just the cumulative product of the
#' scalefactors. As obvious, its length coincides with the length of
#' y.
