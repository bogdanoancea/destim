#' The forward part of the FB algorithm
#'
#' Calculates the forward probabilities.
#'
#' This function has two main purposes: on the one hand it is called by
#' logLik to compute the likelihood, and on the other hand it is combined
#' with backward algorithm to calculate smooth states and smooth
#' consecutive pairwise states by functions sstates and scpstates.
#'
#' @param x A HMM model.
#' @param y A vector with the observed events. It admits missing values.
#'
#' @return A list with two elements:
#' \itemize{
#' \item \emph{alpha} is a matrix that contains the filtered states.
#' The number of columns coincides with the number of observations,
#' so that column k contains the filtered state at the same time as
#' y[k] is observed. For missing (un)observed values, the predicted
#' state is returned instead.
#' \item \emph{scalefactors} is a vector that containts the likelihood
#' of each observation conditioned on all the observation from its
#' past. It is conveniently set to one for missing (un)observed values,
#' so that the joint likelihood is just the cumulative product of the
#' scalefactors.As obvious, its length coincides with the length of
#' y.
